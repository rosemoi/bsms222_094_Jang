title: "Genetic Links Between Autism and Suicidal Behavior"

It was out of simple curiosity to explore the links between Autistic Disorder and Suicidal behaviors.

In order to do so, first thing to be done was to 'tyding' the data.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library("readxl")
setwd("D:/RStudio/bsms222/bsms222_094_Jang/autism")
d1 = read_xlsx('aav8130_Data-S1.xlsx')
d2 = read_xlsx('aav8130_Data-S2.xlsx')
d3 = read_xls('aav8130_Data-S3.xls')
d4 = read_xls('aav8130_Data-S4.xls')
d5 = read_xlsx('aav8130_Data-S5.xlsx')

d1$`Cause of death`

d1 %>%
  filter(`Cause of death` %in% c("Suicide, Hanging" , "Suicide, hanging"))
d2 %>%
  filter(individual %in% c('5294','5841', '5879', '4341', '5554'))

```
I have came down on to possible individuals who might have shown and succeeded in suicides. And therefore continue to explore cell cluster by these individuals.

```{r}
ScD <- d2 %>% filter(individual %in% c('5294','5841', '5879', '4341', '5554')) %>%
  select(individual, cluster) %>% arrange(individual) %>%
  distinct()
SCD <- split(ScD$cluster, ScD$individual)

SCD
```
For each individuals, It was sorted into specific cell clusters. So now, See the data in visualization form for the number of genes per cluster.

```{r}
SCD2 <- d2 %>% 
  filter(individual %in% c('5294','5841', '5879', '4341', '5554'))%>%
  select(individual, cluster, genes) %>%
  arrange(individual) %>%
  distinct()


SCD2 %>% ggplot( mapping = aes(x = cluster, y = genes)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip()
```

Also, the distribution of genes in cluster for each individual.

```{r}
SCD2 %>% ggplot( mapping = aes(x = as.character(individual), y = cluster, size = genes), ) + 
  geom_point()
```


## Further discussion 

The relative general data that will be compared to our "single-cell method" generated data is: 

```
Coon, H., Darlington, T.M., DiBlasi, E. et al. Genome-wide significant regions in 43 Utah high-risk families implicate multiple genes involved in risk for completed suicide. Mol Psychiatry 25, 3077â€“3090 (2020). http://doi.org.ssl.oca.korea.ac.kr/10.1038/s41380-018-0282-3
```


```{r}
UTAH <- read_xlsx('Utah_table3.xlsx')
UTAH <- UTAH %>%
  select(`Gene name`, `Suicide associations; other neuropsychiatric associationsa`)

UTAH

Gene <- UTAH %>% filter(`Gene name` %in% c('CDK5', 'INPP1'))

Gene
```

Since the advancement of "single cell" method, further genetic link study in Autism and Suicide can be done and these are possible genes from the research we did portfolio on.

```{r}
aa <- d4 %>%
  filter(`Cell type` %in% c("AST-PP", "Oligodendrocytes", "L5/6", "L2/3", "AST-FB", "Neu-NRGN-II", "IN-VIP", "Microglia", "L5/6-CC", "Neu-NRGN-I", "OPC", "IN-SST", "Neu-mat", "Endothelial", "IN-PV", "L4", "IN-SV2C")) %>% select('Gene name')

aa
```
